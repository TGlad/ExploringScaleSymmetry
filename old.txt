## Linux:

The GUI of Chapter 6 requires freeglut to be installed, using:

```sudo apt install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev libglew-dev
sudo apt install mesa-utils```

Or by downloading from http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/ version 3.2.1 has been tested.

Install the Eigen3 vector library:

```sudo apt install libeigen3-dev```

Then build, from within the ExploringScaleSymmetry root folder:

```cd ExploringScaleSymemtry
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
cd ..```

Now run using

```build/exploringScaleSymmetry C F```

where C is the chapter number and F is the figure number to run.
